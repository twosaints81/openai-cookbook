    "# Power your products with ChatGPT and your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a walkthrough taking readers through how to build starter Q&A and Chatbot applications using the ChatGPT API and their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is laid out in these sections:\n",
    "- **Setup:** \n",
    "    - Initiate variables and source the data\n",
    "- **Lay the foundations:**\n",
    "    - Set up the vector database to accept vectors and data\n",
    "    - Load the dataset, chunk the data up for embedding and store in the vector database\n",
    "- **Make it a product:**\n",
    "    - Add a retrieval step where users provide queries and we return the most relevant entries\n",
    "    - Summarise search results with GPT-4\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Q&A app in Streamlit\n",
    "- **Build your moat:**\n",
    "    - Create an Assistant class to manage context and interact with our bot\n",
    "    - Use the Chatbot to answer questions using semantic search context\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Chatbot app in Streamlit\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upon completion, you have the building blocks to create your own production chatbot or Q&A application using OpenAI APIs and a vector database.\n",

Where a patient’s sole skilled service need is for skilled   oversight of unskilled services (management and evaluation of the care plan as   defined in §40.1.2.2), the physician or allowed practitioner must include a brief   narrative describing the clinical justification of this need as part of the recertification,   or as a signed addendum to the recertification      3.

       "0       If the patient is starting home health directly after discharge from an acute/post-acute care   setting where the physician or allowed practitioner, with privileges, that cared for the   patient in that setting is certifying the patient’s eligibility for the home health benefit, but   will not be following the patient after discharge, then the certifying physician or allowed   practitioner must identify the community physician or allowed practitioner who will be   following the patient after discharge. One of the criteria that must be met for a patient to   be considered eligible for the home health benefit is that the patient must be under the   care of a physician or allowed practitioner (number 4 listed above). Otherwise, the   certification is not valid.     The certification must be complete prior to when an HHA bills Medicare for   reimbursement  however, physicians and allowed practitioners should complete the   certification when the plan of care is established, or as soon as possible thereafter. This is   longstanding CMS policy as referenced in Pub 100-01, Medicare General Information,   Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, chapter 4, section 30.1. It is not acceptable for   HHAs to wait until the end of a 60-day certification period to obtain a completed   certification/recertification.     30.5.1.1 – Face-to-Face Encounter   (Rev. 10438, Issued: 11-06-20, Effective: 03-01-20, Implementation: 01- 11-21)     1. Allowed Provider Types     As part of the certification of patient eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit, a   face-to-face encounter with the patient must be performed by the certifying physician or   allowed practitioner himself or herself, a physician or allowed practitioner that cared for   the patient in the acute or post-acute care facility (with privileges who cared for the   patient in an acute or post-acute care facility from which the patient was directly admitted   to home health) or an allowed non-physician practitioner (NPP).   \n",
       "1       For recertification of home health services, the physician or allowed practitioner must   certify (attest) that:     1. The home health services are or were needed because the patient is or was   confined to the home as defined in §30.1      2. The patient needs or needed skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis (other   than solely venipuncture for the purposes of obtaining a blood sample), or physical   therapy, or speech-language pathology services  or continues to need occupational   therapy after the need for skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech-language   pathology services ceased. Where a patient’s sole skilled service need is for skilled   oversight of unskilled services (management and evaluation of the care plan as   defined in §40.1.2.2), the physician or allowed practitioner must include a brief   narrative describing the clinical justification of this need as part of the recertification,   or as a signed addendum to the recertification      3. A plan of care has been established and is periodically reviewed by a physician or   allowed practitioner  and     4. The services are or were furnished while the patient is or was under the care of a   physician or allowed practitioner.     Medicare does not limit the number of continuous 60-day recertifications for   beneficiaries who continue to be eligible for the home health benefit. The certification   may cover a period less than but not greater than 60 days. Because the updated home   health plan of care must include the frequency and duration of visits to be made, the   physician or allowed practitioner does not have to estimate how much longer skilled   services will be needed for the recertification.      30.5.3 - Who May Sign the Certification or Recertification   (Rev. 10738, Issued: 05-07-21, Effective: 01-01-21, Implementation: 08-09-21)     The physician or allowed practitioner who signs the certification or recertification must   be permitted to do so by 42 CFR 424.22.         \n",

      "1. Create a Social Media Marketing Plan: I can help you develop a social media marketing plan that aligns with your business goals. This plan can include strategies for creating engaging content, targeting your audience to reach a wider audience, and leveraging social media advertising to promote your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Develop a Customer Loyalty Program: A customer loyalty program can be an effective way to retain customers and grow your business. I can help you develop a program that rewards your customers for repeat business, referrals, and other actions that support your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Conduct Market Research: Every successful business needs to stay up-to-date with the latest market trends and customer preferences. I can conduct market research on your behalf to help you make informed decisions about your business's product or service offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Streamline Your Business Operations: I can help you identify areas where your business operations can be more efficient. By automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows, you can save time and increase productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Create a Website: A website is an essential tool for any business in the digital age. I can help you create a website that showcases your products or services, and provides customers with an easy way to purchase or contact your business.\n",

By doing this, you can save time, reduce costs, and increase productivity, which can help your business grow.\n",

      "Here are some ways that I can help you streamline your business operations:\n",

      "2. Automate Repetitive Tasks: There are likely many tasks that are performed repeatedly in your business, such as data entry, invoicing, or scheduling. By automating these tasks, you can save time and free up your team to focus on more important tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Integrate Your Systems: Do you have multiple systems that don't communicate with each other? Integrating these systems can save time and reduce errors by eliminating the need to manually transfer data between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Reduce Paperwork: Paperwork can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. By digitizing your documents and forms, you can streamline the process and reduce the risk of errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Implement Project Management Tools: If you have multiple team members working on different projects, project management tools can help streamline the process. By using these tools, you can assign tasks, track progress, and ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal.\n",
